### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

My github has a few public homebrew projects that maybe of interest:

* [jokeapp](https://github.com/ryjen/jokeapp) and [jokeapp-droid](https://github.com/ryjen/jokeapp-droid) are hello world apps in `react-native` and `kotlin`.

* [scouter](https://github.com/ryjen/scouter) was a turn based game in react-native that is temporarily abandoned.

* [prep](https://github.com/ryjen/prep) is an attempt to make a useful C++ project build and dependency tool. Plugin based functionality.

* [libcoda](https://github.com/ryjen/libcoda) are some modern C++ toolkit.  Notable sub projects to be proud of are [libcoda-net](https://github.com/ryjen/libcoda-net) and [libcoda-db](https://github.com/ryjen/libcoda-db).

* [quotes](https://github.com/ryjen/quotes) is some AWS lambda API experimentation in go.

* [mitm](https://github.com/ryjen/mitm) is a man-in-the-middle project to virtually create an attack in a virtual environment.

* [sandbox](https://github.com/hackelia-micrantha/sandbox) is an early stage tool in golang to make development inside a container easier (file sync, networking, reuse)

* [stimulus](https://github.com/hackelia-micrantha/stimulus) is a golang behaviour driven testing framework that I think is more intuitive while remaining simple to golang standard testing.

* [dotfiles](https://github.com/ryjen/dotfiles) are my configuration files.  Managed in a simple but effective manner with GNU `stow`.

* [hangman](https://github.com/ryjen/hangman) was an early react-native project to play a game of hangman, now abandoned.

* [color-luminence](https://github.com/ryjen/color-luminance) was a modification that that turned into a rewrite and not pushed back.
