### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

My github has a few public homebrew projects that maybe of interest:

* [jokeapp](https://github.com/ryjen/jokeapp) and [jokeapp-droid](https://github.com/ryjen/jokeapp-droid) are hello world apps in `react-native` and `kotlin`.

* [graphva](https://github.com/ryjen/graphva) java implmentation for a graph and related algorithms and data structures.

* [prep](https://github.com/ryjen/prep) is an attempt to make a [CLI](https://github.com/ryjen/prep-cli) build and dependency tool. [Plugin](https://github.com/ryjen/prep-plugins) based functionality to be flexible to any C++ legacy dependency and build system.

* [libcoda](https://github.com/ryjen/libcoda) are some modern `C++` toolkit.  Notable sub projects to be proud of are [libcoda-net](https://github.com/ryjen/libcoda-net) and [libcoda-db](https://github.com/ryjen/libcoda-db).

* [quotes](https://github.com/ryjen/quotes) is some `AWS lambda` API experimentation in `golang`.

* [mitm](https://github.com/ryjen/mitm) is a `man-in-the-middle` project to virtually create an attack in a virtual environment.

* [swiftactoe](https://github.com/ryjen/swiftactoe) is a test of opensource swift in ubuntu docker with a minmax algorithm and imported C library for multiplayer.

* [operating system demos](https://github.com/ryjen/os) in `C` for [scheduling algorithms](https://github.com/ryjen/scheduling-algos) and a [shell](https://github.com/ryjen/shell) implementation.

* [sandbox](https://github.com/hackelia-micrantha/sandbox) is an early stage tool in `golang` to make development inside a container easier (file sync, networking, reuse)

* [stimulus](https://github.com/hackelia-micrantha/stimulus) is a `golang` behaviour driven testing framework that I think is more intuitive while remaining simple and true to standard testing.

* [dotfiles](https://github.com/ryjen/dotfiles) are my configuration files.  Managed in a simple but effective manner with GNU `stow`.

* [scouter](https://github.com/ryjen/scouter) was a turn based game in `react-native` that is temporarily abandoned.

* [hangman](https://github.com/ryjen/hangman) was an early `react-native` project to play a game of hangman, now abandoned.

* [color-luminence](https://github.com/ryjen/color-luminance) was a modification to an opensource javascript library. turned into a rewrite and not pushed back.
